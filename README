======

This project shall provide reliable, easy to use and fast methods and tools 
to check websites and webinterfaces.

Webtest suites can be set up and run.  A test can set header information
to send to the server and check the response:  Returned header values and
the body.  To facilliate tests for tags a tag-language allows to find/count
tags matching certain conditions.

The reference-suite.wt is the documentation of how to set up the plain 
text files used to define a test suite.

Webtest itself needs some packages: tag, suite and stat which might be usefull
as standalone packages.
